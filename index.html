        <h1>A Thousand Days to Keep the Millennium Promise</h1>
        <h2>A journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step, but starting this week we can march a thousand days forward into a new future. On June 5th, the world will reach a vital moment in history's largest and most successful anti-poverty push -- the 1,000-day mark before the target date to achieve the Millennium Development Goals. <!-- These eight concrete goals were set in the year 2000, when more leaders than ever before gathered at the United Nations and agreed to cut global poverty and hunger by half, fight climate change and disease, tackle unsafe water and sanitation, expand education and open doors of opportunity for girls and women. It was not the first time leaders had made lofty promises. Cynics expected the MDGs to be abandoned as too ambitious. Instead, the Goals have helped set global and national priorities, mobilize action, and achieve remarkable results. --> </h2>

          <p>In 2000, 189 nations made a promise to free people from extreme poverty and multiple deprivations. This pledge turned into the eight Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). On June 5, 2013, the MDGs deadline will be just 1,000 days away. The world has entered the final leg of its momentous 15-year journey to halve extreme poverty, reduce child mortality by two-thirds, reverse the tide against HIV/AIDS and malaria, and ensure that more people have access to basic services, such as primary education and safe drinking water. <br /><br />

          The MDGs amount to a promise the world made to itself. They are commitments that we have all made to each other. The 2015 deadline, which once seemed so far off, is now fast approaching. So it is time to ask ourselves a series of pointed questions. Where do we stand on these ambitious goals? Have we collectively done enough to convert them into reality? And what needs to happen during the last 1,000 days to ensure that the world not only sprints to the finish line –but blows right through it?

        <h1>How successful have they been?</h1>          
        <br /><p>Three years to the deadline, we can report broad progress on the MDGs. The Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) agreed to by world leaders over a decade ago have achieved important results. Working together, Governments, the United Nations family, the private sector and civil society have succeeded in saving many lives and improving conditions for many more. The world has met some important targets—ahead of the deadline. </p>

        <div class="goal">
          <h3>Extreme poverty falls in every region</h3>
          <p>For the first time since the World Bank started to monitor poverty trends, both the number of people living in extreme poverty and the poverty rates fell in every region. In the developing world, the proportion of people living on less than $1.25 a day fell from 47 per cent in 1990 to 24 per cent in 2008. The number of extreme poor in the developing regions fell from over 2 billion in 1990 to less than 1.4 billion in 2008. Preliminary estimates indicate that the global poverty rate at $1.25 a day fell in 2010 to less than half the 1990 rate. </p>

          <h3>The world has met the MDG drinking water target, five years ahead of schedule</h3>
          <p>In 2010, 89 per cent of the world’s population was using improved drinking water sources, up from 76 per cent in 1990. This means that the MDG target of halving the proportion of the population without sustainable access to safe drinking water has been met, five years ahead of the 2015 target. If current trends continue, 92 per cent of the global population will be covered by 2015.</p>

          <h3>3 Improvements in the lives of 200 million slum dwellers bring achievement of the MDG target</h3>
          <p>The share of urban residents in the developing world living in slums declined from 39 per cent in 2000 to 33 percent in 2012. More than 200 million gained access to either improved water sources, improved sanitation facilities, or durable or less crowded housing. This achievement exceeds the target of significantly improving the lives of at least 100 million slum dwellers, well ahead of the 2020 deadline.</p>

        <!-- Part Three -->
        <hr />
        <h1>Long Way Ahead</h1>
        <p>There has undoubtedly been progress on many of the indicators targeted by the MDGs. However, there are also the goals and targets where too little progress has been made; there are goals we are unlikely to achieve by the end of 2014.</p>

        <h3>Child mortality falls by more than one third, but progress is still too slow to reach the target</h3>
        <p>We are only halfway toward meeting the goal of reducing the childhood mortality rate by two-thirds. In 2010, 82 percent of under-five child deaths occurred in sub-Saharan Africa and Southern Asia -- a larger share of the global total than when the MDGs were enacted. </p>
        <iframe width="690" height="600" src="http://devdata.worldbank.org/global-monitoring-report/DVMap.swf?u=eNodjTkOwzAMBB%252FDdmPwEEWZ34mqVIGvwL8P4WYw2Cn2d9%252BfazvX66QpqTQ1X0LTHm4Pv6lsUA5IC6iW%252B4A1jIBBBsRp3qlKR9KezrS%252FU5aBvlT2RaGjLBQmrVpFaypRgzgbszOkm3uvm5LgahBjk7AO4XVtaoOuI%252F%252BGLigQ"></iframe>
        
        <h3>Maternal mortality has nearly halved since 1990, but levels are far removed from the 2015 target</h3>
        <p>An estimated 287,000 maternal deaths occurred in 2010 worldwide, a decline of 47 per cent from 1990. But Sub-Saharan Africa (with 56 per cent of these deaths) and Southern Asia (29 per cent) together accounted for 85 per cent of the global burden in 2010, with 245,000 maternal deaths between them. The number of maternal deaths per 100,000 live births—the maternal mortality ratio, or MMR—was also down, but in developing regions it was still 15 times higher than in the developed regions.</p>
        <center><iframe frameborder="0" width="415" height="425" scrolling="no" src="http://databank.worldbank.org/Data/embed/Maternal_mortality_ratio/ID/ed7ad138/wd/415/ht/425/tbar/n/dd/n/print/y/export/y/xlbl/y/ylbl/y/legend/y"></iframe></center>
        
        <h3>Core development aid falls in real terms for the first time in more than a decade, as donor countries face fiscal constraints.</h3>
        <p>The Millennium Development Goal Target 8 calls for more generous official development assistance (ODA) for countries committed to poverty reduction. But the protracted global economic crisis has begun to take its toll on international development cooperation. Last year, ODA fell for the first time in many years. The 23 donor nations, which are members of the Development Assistance Committee of the Paris-based Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (DAC/OECD), provided about 133.5 billion dollars in ODA in 2011, leaving a shortfall of about 167 billion dollars.</p>

        <h4>The MDGs have proven that focused global development objectives can make a profound difference. They can mobilize, unite and inspire. They can spark innovation and change the world. Success in the next 1,000 days will not only improve the lives of millions, it will add momentum as we plan for beyond 2015 and the challenges of sustainable development. </h4>

        <!-- Part Four -->
        <h1>Keep the conversation going!</h1>
        <p>Starting today, the UN will work with partners around the world to spur momentum to achieve greater gains by the 2015 target date. On social media platforms, UN agencies, partners, and individuals are participating in 1,000 minutes of online programming about building momentum under the Twitter hashtag #MDGmomentum. Organized in partnership with UN Foundation, participants are invited to be active in Google hang-outs, Facebook chats and Twitter dialogues about the MDGs from across the world through 5 June, at 1pm EDT. <br /><br />Keep the conversation going!</p>
